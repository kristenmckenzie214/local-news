          Metairie (La.) St. Martin's Episcopal five-star running back Harlem
          Berry put pen to paper with the LSU Tigers on National Signing Day
          this week. Berry, the No. 1 running back in America, made things
          official with Brian Kelly and Co. after a rigorous recruiting
          process.The Louisiana star committed to the Bayou Bengals on Jan. 3,
          but it didn't stop other programs from putting the full-court press on
          the top-ranked prospect in the state. At the end of the day, despite
          significant pushes from a number of premier programs, Berry remained
          true to his LSU commitment. "Before I even made the decision, I knew
          where I wanted to go," Berry said on Signing Day, "and once I made it,
          I was locked in. Nothing was going to change my mind."Berry has proven
          to be big on loyalty and relationships, which paved the way for the
          five-star to put pen to paper with the Tigers on Wednesday. "I built a
          great relationship with (LSU running backs coach Frank Wilson)," Berry
          said. "All the other coaches at the other universities, I felt that
          they could get me where I needed to get. But it was just that
          connection I had with coach Frank. It was more than just football."
          Berry's mother echoed the same sentiment in an interview with The
          Advocate:"Being from the South, you know the hospitality here was
          overwhelming, as opposed to all of the other colleges that we
          visited," Tonika said. "And what we looked at was the family. We are
          big on family. And when we went to LSU, we weren't introduced to one
          set group of (people). We were introduced to parents, coaches, other
          athletes. It was just like a family." Now, Berry's prep career is in
          the rearview mirror where he is set to be an early-enrollee and make
          his way to Baton Rouge in January, but the accolades continue rolling
          in for the Bayou State star.

          Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram exited Saturday night's 119-109 loss
          to the Oklahoma City Thunder after suffering a left ankle injury 17
          seconds into the second half. Ingram was ruled out for the rest of the
          game minutes later.Ingram rolled his ankle when he landed on the foot
          of Oklahoma City's Lu Dort after attempting a jump shot. Ingram, whose
          elbow struck Dort in the face as he was going up for the shot, was
          whistled for an offensive foul. Ingram, who leads the injury-ravaged
          Pelicans in scoring at 23.2 points per game, had to be helped off the
          floor and to the locker room. Ingram missed five games due to right
          plantaris tendinitis before returning for Thursday's win over the
          Phoenix Suns, when he scored 29 points as the Pelicans snapped a
          nine-game losing streak. Ingram was held to five points on 1-of-4
          shooting against the Thunder, who led by 26 at halftime.
