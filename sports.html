          Metairie (La.) St. Martin's Episcopal five-star running back Harlem
          Berry put pen to paper with the LSU Tigers on National Signing Day
          this week. Berry, the No. 1 running back in America, made things
          official with Brian Kelly and Co. after a rigorous recruiting
          process.The Louisiana star committed to the Bayou Bengals on Jan. 3,
          but it didn't stop other programs from putting the full-court press on
          the top-ranked prospect in the state. At the end of the day, despite
          significant pushes from a number of premier programs, Berry remained
          true to his LSU commitment. "Before I even made the decision, I knew
          where I wanted to go," Berry said on Signing Day, "and once I made it,
          I was locked in. Nothing was going to change my mind."Berry has proven
          to be big on loyalty and relationships, which paved the way for the
          five-star to put pen to paper with the Tigers on Wednesday. "I built a
          great relationship with (LSU running backs coach Frank Wilson)," Berry
          said. "All the other coaches at the other universities, I felt that
          they could get me where I needed to get. But it was just that
          connection I had with coach Frank. It was more than just football."
          Berry's mother echoed the same sentiment in an interview with The
          Advocate:"Being from the South, you know the hospitality here was
          overwhelming, as opposed to all of the other colleges that we
          visited," Tonika said. "And what we looked at was the family. We are
          big on family. And when we went to LSU, we weren't introduced to one
          set group of (people). We were introduced to parents, coaches, other
          athletes. It was just like a family." Now, Berry's prep career is in
          the rearview mirror where he is set to be an early-enrollee and make
          his way to Baton Rouge in January, but the accolades continue rolling
          in for the Bayou State star.

          Pelicans forward Brandon Ingram exited Saturday night's 119-109 loss
          to the Oklahoma City Thunder after suffering a left ankle injury 17
          seconds into the second half. Ingram was ruled out for the rest of the
          game minutes later.Ingram rolled his ankle when he landed on the foot
          of Oklahoma City's Lu Dort after attempting a jump shot. Ingram, whose
          elbow struck Dort in the face as he was going up for the shot, was
          whistled for an offensive foul. Ingram, who leads the injury-ravaged
          Pelicans in scoring at 23.2 points per game, had to be helped off the
          floor and to the locker room. Ingram missed five games due to right
          plantaris tendinitis before returning for Thursday's win over the
          Phoenix Suns, when he scored 29 points as the Pelicans snapped a
          nine-game losing streak. Ingram was held to five points on 1-of-4
          shooting against the Thunder, who led by 26 at halftime.

        <h2>New Orleans 'Crawdaddy's' come to life</h2>

          In season two of IFC's Brockmire, the titular character (played by
          Hank Azaria) works as the home broadcaster for the New Orleans
          Crawdaddy's. The Crawdaddy's -- yes, the name features unaccountably
          incorrect apostrophe usage -- are a fictional entity. But earlier this
          week, they briefly became reality. The New Orleans Baby Cakes --
          Triple-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins -- suited up as the
          Crawdaddy's for May 1's Brockmire Night, a celebration of the offbeat
          and oft-raunchy baseball-centric comedy. In this regard, it was
          similar to the Myrtle Beach Pelicans' 2016 Mermen promotion, with the
          Pelicans assuming the identity of the team that Kenny Powers (Danny
          McBride) played for in season three of HBO's Eastbound and Down. The
          Baby Cakes' one-night-only rebranding had a clear New Orleans tie-in,
          as the second season takes place within the Crescent City. But the
          promotion began to take shape over a year ago, well before the New
          Orleans Crawdaddy's were a Brockmire plot point. As is so often the
          case these days, it all began with a tweet. "It was April 17 [2017]. I
          was sitting on the couch watching Brockmire," said Baby Cakes
          corporate sales executive Trevor Johnson, the driving force behind the
          promotion. "It was probably the third episode. I'm watching it, like,
          'This show's hilarious!' So, I sent out a tweet, 'Hey, how can I get
          Hank Azaria, as Brockmire, to come PA a game?' I included Sazerac,
          because that's his drink of choice and Sazerac is from New Orleans.
          "Hours after that, I got a response from Blake Callaway. 'IFC wants to
          help.' He's an executive vice president with IFC, so we went from
          there. We started sending emails back and forth. ... A couple months
          later, we emailed again. He had introduced me to other marketing
          people within IFC. It ramped up, and eventually he told us that
          Brockmire would be taking a job with the New Orleans Crawdaddy's."
