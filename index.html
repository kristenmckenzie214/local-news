          Oncologists Alarmed as Cancer Cases Rise Among Younger Generations

          Oncologists are raising alarms as the American Cancer Society reports
          a concerning increase in cancer cases and deaths among younger
          generations.Adele Wilkerson was just 36 years old when she was
          diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of breast cancer. After
          undergoing chemotherapy, radiation, and a mastectomy, she went into
          remission for a few years. But the cancer returned.Doctors gave
          Wilkerson 18 months to live, but she defied the odds for nine years
          before succumbing to the disease on Oct. 1, 2014—the start of Breast
          Cancer Awareness Month.Dr. Jonathan Mizrahi, a medical oncologist at
          Ochsner MD Anderson Cancer Center, said he’s seeing more aggressive
          and advanced tumors in younger patients in their 20s to 40s.He
          estimates that 5% to 10% of his pancreatic cancer patients are now
          under age 50, even though the average age for the disease is 70. A
          recent American Cancer Society study highlights a troubling trend: 17
          types of cancer are becoming more prevalent in younger generations,
          with death rates also rising. Among millennials, cases of pancreatic,
          kidney, small intestine, and liver cancers (in females) are about
          three times higher than in baby boomers at the same age.

          In our modern world, 3D printers create all kinds of products, from
          clothing to artificial limbs.A pair of Louisiana companies are
          employing the technology to tailor solutions to Louisiana’s coastal
          land loss. Using a one-of-a-kind design, Natrx manufactures “Cajun
          Coral,” a 3D-printed mix of cement and sand which it molds into
          modules for shoreline protection or artificial reefs. “You’d be
          surprised. We’ve got some (reefs) that in six months are completely
          covered with crabs and oysters,” said Leonard Nelson, a Natrx
          co-founder.The company has partnered with Danos Ventures to
          manufacture the Cajun Coral at the Danos industrial yard in Amelia.

          Opponents Slam Amendment 1 as Injecting Politics into Vital Procedures

          A former member of the state’s Judiciary Commission and a former
          staffer of the commission slammed an amendment to add five new members
          to the commission and overhaul some procedures. The Judiciary
          Commission is responsible for receiving and investigating complaints
          into sitting judges in Louisiana. Advocates are praising the
          amendment, which was created in Senate Bill 177, as a way to place
          guardrails on Louisiana judges whom they view as too lenient on
          criminals. They also claim the Judiciary Commission is not transparent
          enough and doesn’t act swiftly enough when receiving complaints.SB177
          passed through both the Louisiana House of Representatives and Senate
          in near-unanimous votes of approval.The amendment would add five
          members to the already nine-member Judiciary Commission. The added
          members would be appointed by the legislature and governor. Currently,
          the nine members consist of an appeal judge and two district judges,
          three attorneys and three non-lawyer citizens.All are appointed by
          either the Supreme Court or judicial associations.
