  <h2>Oncologists alarmed as cancer cases rise among younger generations</h2>
  <p>Oncologists are raising alarms as the American Cancer Society reports a concerning increase in cancer cases and deaths among younger generations.</p>
  <p>Adele Wilkerson was just 36 years old when she was diagnosed with a rare, aggressive form of breast cancer. After undergoing chemotherapy, radiation, and a mastectomy, she went into remission for a few years. But the cancer returned.</p>
  <p>Doctors gave Wilkerson 18 months to live, but she defied the odds for nine years before succumbing to the disease on Oct. 1, 2014—the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</p>
  <p>Dr. Jonathan Mizrahi, a medical oncologist at Ochsner MD Anderson Cancer Center, said he’s seeing more aggressive and advanced tumors in younger patients in their 20s to 40s.</p>
  <p>He estimates that 5% to 10% of his pancreatic cancer patients are now under age 50, even though the average age for the disease is 70</p>
  <p>A recent American Cancer Society study highlights a troubling trend: 17 types of cancer are becoming more prevalent in younger generations, with death rates also rising.</p>
  <p>Among millennials, cases of pancreatic, kidney, small intestine, and liver cancers (in females) are about three times higher than in baby boomers at the same age.</p>
  <h2>How 3D printers help to protect Louisiana’s coast</h2>
  <p>In our modern world, 3D printers create all kinds of products, from clothing to artificial limbs.</p>
  <p>A pair of Louisiana companies are employing the technology to tailor solutions to Louisiana’s coastal land loss.</p>
  <p>Using a one-of-a-kind design, Natrx manufactures “Cajun Coral,” a 3D-printed mix of cement and sand which it molds into modules for shoreline protection or artificial reefs.</p>
  <p>“You’d be surprised. We’ve got some (reefs) that in six months are completely covered with crabs and oysters,” said Leonard Nelson, a Natrx co-founder.</p>
  <p>The company has partnered with Danos Ventures to manufacture the Cajun Coral at the Danos industrial yard in Amelia.</p>
